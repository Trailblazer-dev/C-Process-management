# Process Management

This repository contains code examples and explanations related to process management in operating systems. It covers various concepts such as forking processes, communicating between processes using pipes, copying files between processes, and more.

## Contents

- [Calling `fork` Multiple Times](calling_fork_multiple_times.c)
  - Description: This program demonstrates how to create multiple child processes using the `fork` system call.
- [Communicating Between Processes Using Pipes](communicating_between_processes_using_pipes.c)
  - Description: This program illustrates inter-process communication using pipes.
- [File Copy](file_copy.c)
  - Description: This program copies a file from one location to another.
- [Process PID](process_pid.c)
  - Description: This program displays the process ID (PID) of the current process.
- [Process Wait](process_wait.c)
  - Description: This program demonstrates the use of the `wait` system call to wait for child processes to finish execution.

## Directory Structure

- `output/`: Directory containing output files generated by the programs.
- `main`: Main executable file.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
